    algorith given list gexf files and save corresponding graph files.

    Given a set of graphs from the dataset, a maximum h for WL, and 
    the label attribute name used in the gexf files we initially relabel
    the original labels into a compliant relabeling (caesar shift for 
    ease) then perform max-h iterations of the WL relabeling algorithm 
    (1979) to create new labels which are compressed versions of the 
    rooted subgraphs for each node in the graph. These are all present
    in the nx graph objects's nodes as attributes, with the original 
    label being 'Label' and our subsequent relabelings in the "relabel"
    attribute
    
    The main use case is for the user to input a path containing individual
    graphs of the dataset in gexf format.
    The decomposition algorithm will induce substructure patterns for graphs
    recording the dataset/"global" vocabulary of patterns within a dictionary.
    The graph and its associated patterns (by IDs given through our hash function)
    are saved into a  <graphid>.wldr<depth> file which contains a line delimited
    list of all the substructure pattern ids.
