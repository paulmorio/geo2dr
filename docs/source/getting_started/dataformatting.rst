Graph datasets, data formats and processing
===========================================

An important aspect of research is being able to develop methods and subsequently apply them onto the same datasets under the same conditions (as far as possible) to provide "fairer" comparisons. As such Geo2DR aims to provide tools to transform public datasets from popular repositories such as `TU Dortmund Graph Kernel Data <https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/staff/morris/graphkerneldatasets>`_ into formats usable in Geo2DR modules (and elsewhere).

Basic overview
--------------

Geo2DR uses the Graph Exchange Format (GEXF) as its main medium for storing and reading graphs. This choice comes from the point that graphs stored in the GEXF format can be used in popular network analysis software such as Gephi and NetworkX. Therefore a collection of graphs would practically be a directory containing `.gexf` files. Modules of the `decomposition` subpackage would be able to
